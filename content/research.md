      title: 'ðŸ“š Active Architecture Security'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        The relentless advancement and pervasive integration of information technology bring forth profound and novel challenges to the realm of cyberspace security. Within this landscape, critical information infrastructure and pivotal information systems inevitably contend with the specter of software and hardware vulnerabilities, compounded by the ceaseless emergence of obscure threats. Conventional paradigms of defense and established security methodologies find themselves inadequately equipped to navigate these evolving complexities. We find ourselves ensnared within an unyielding cycle of identifying vulnerabilities and hastily patching themâ€”a cycle that underscores an acute exigency for fresh perspectives and innovative technologies in defense.

        In response, we advocate for the adoption of the Active Architecture Security framework. Central to our proposition is the acknowledgment that the efficacy of exploiting software and hardware vulnerabilities is rooted in the intrinsic security frailties embedded within fundamental information technologies, notably CPUs and operating systems. Active Architecture Security espouses an approach commencing with an in-depth analysis of vulnerability exploitation mechanisms and attack vectors. It endeavors to pinpoint the underlying security vulnerabilities within information technology infrastructures that assailants exploit in the backdrop of system vulnerabilities. Grounded in the imperative of security requisites, this approach necessitates the reengineering and refinement of extant information technologies. This reconfiguration aims to endow these technologies with the capacity to efficaciously curtail, discern, regulate, and eradicate security threats stemming from their inherent vulnerabilities, thereby effecting a metamorphosis from mere "information technology + security" to fortified "secure information technology."

        Diverging from conventional methodologies fixated on patching vulnerabilities, Active Architecture Security does not seek outright elimination of vulnerabilities but instead endeavors to render them impotent. Moreover, it diverges from the conventional "security door model" of perimeter defense and defense in depth, as well as the "safe box model" predicated on zero trust. Through proactive embedded defenses, it establishes a paradigm akin to a "hidden treasure model," with its focal point squarely centered on the avenues of attack.
