abstract: 'With the development of computing and communication technologies, an extremely
  large amount of data has been collected, stored, utilized, and shared, while new
  security and privacy challenges arise. Existing access control mechanisms provided
  by big data platforms have limitations in granularity and expressiveness. In this
  article, we present SparkAC, a novel access control mechanism for secure data sharing
  and analysis in Spark. In particular, we first propose a purpose-aware access control
  (PAAC) model, which introduces new concepts of data processing purpose and data
  operation purposeand an automatic purpose analysis algorithm that identifies purposes
  from data analytics operations and queries. Moreover, we develop a unified access
  control mechanism that implements PAAC model in two modules. GuardSpark++ supports
  structured data access control in Spark Catalyst and GuardDAG supports unstructured
  data access control in Spark core. Finally, we evaluate GuardSpark++ and GuardDAG
  with multiple data sources, applications, and data analytics engines. Experimental
  results show that SparkAC provides effective access control functionalities with
  very small (GuardSpark++) or medium (GuardDAG) performance overhead.'
